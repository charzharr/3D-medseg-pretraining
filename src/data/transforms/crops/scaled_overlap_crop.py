""" scaled_overlap_crop.py (Author: Charley Zhang, 2021)
A transform that only works on 3D tensors & np arrays. It's used to reimplement
the PGL overlapping crop feature needed for contrastive pretraining.

PGL Transformations (2 spatial, 4 intensity): 
- Crop & Scale (110% to 140% of final crop size), at least 10% overlap
- 50% flip along x, y, z axis
- Gaussian noise (uniform from 0 to 0.1 variance), p=0.1
- Gaussian blur (sigma=[0.5, 1]) p=0.2
- Brightness / contrast (1st mult by [0.75, 1.25] then clipped), p=0.5
- Gamma transform (Î»=[0.7,1.5], then scaled to [0,1]), p=0.5

Reversal for MSE calculation:
- First reverse axis flipping
- Then reverse the crop/scaling

    Execution Walkthrough
        1. Given a full volume, 1 random crop of size(scale * final_shape)
            is sampled. 
        2. Using the min_overlap parameter & a random valid corner to which
            the 2nd crop will overlap, the 2nd crop is sampled.
            Note: shape of 2nd crop is independent of 1st & sampled in the 
                same way using the scale_range & final_shape.
        3. Both crops are resized to the final_shape & their overlap 
            coordinates are adjusted.
        4. The overlapping crop pair is returned with their meta info. 
    
    PGL Reimplementation Assumptions
    - scale sample applies to each axis equally, not each axis samples own scale
    - only j & k axis have variable scale, i axis has complete overlap always
